This short script, runs through a simple html page (https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/) and using BeautifulSoup4, it fetches every country's name, capital, population and area.
Uses mysql-connector-python to create a simple database with the table called countries.
Then Using scikit-learn and a simple machine learning model, it predicts the area of a country by it's given population.
Obviously the estimation here will not be precise due to the small scale of provided data, but I uploaded this project just to demonstrate how a simple machine learning model can be helpful.
